Using PHP to Calculate Interest on a Loan

Title: Loan Calculator

Purpose: This simple loan calculator serves the purpose of calculating the loan interest and what you must pay back at the due date of the loan.

Instructions: The first thing you should do is ensure the date is correct at the top of the program. Enter the start and due date of the loan, you can use the calender icon to select easily. Then you must enter the interest to be calculated, followed by the amount you borrowed.
The program will then reply with the start and due date details of the loan. Then it will display the loan annual rate, the principle amount borrowed, and the interest total. Finally it will display the full total to be returned to the loaner on due date. Enjoy :)
